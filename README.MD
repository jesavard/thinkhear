#THINKHEAR
----
> This Initial intent of this program is to gather messages,
comments and general information ("like" flags) weight the words, identify the
communication intent and score it -100 to +100.

> A scale closer to 0 from either direction is the
communication that is delivered through logic and reason.

![Slogan - Communication through reason and logic](http://thinkhear.com/images/slogan-sm.png).

Gathering written communication from an individual user and simply index words
 based on a identified usage.  This includes conservative, liberal and neutral.
 Vulgarities are rated as a lack of reason and logic and are scored in a
 separate grouping

    * Conservative
    * Liberal
    * Neutral
    * Neutral

There needs to be a weighting of words and a study of this can be found here

#THE SIMPLE WORD TRICK
 >The researchers found conservatives, more than liberals, tend to refer to things by names, instead of describing them in terms of features.
 Examples of this would be saying someone is an idealist rather than describing them as idealistic, or that someone is a pessimist rather than calling them pessimistic.
 If you describe someone as 'a homosexual' you're more likely to be conservative, while calling someone 'homosexual' - without the 'a' - makes you more liberal.
 This use of nouns, rather than adjectives, is thought to preserve stability, familiarity and tradition, all of which appear to be valued more highly by conservatives than liberals.
